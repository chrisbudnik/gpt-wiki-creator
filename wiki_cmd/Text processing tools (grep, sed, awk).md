# Text Processing Tools

In this article, we will explore three powerful text processing tools available in the command line interface for Mac: `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. These tools are essential for manipulating and analyzing texts efficiently.

## grep

`grep` (global regular expression print) is a command-line utility that searches for patterns in text files. It helps you find specific lines or patterns within files, making it an invaluable tool for text searching and filtering.

### Basic usage

To start, let's learn some basic `grep` commands:

1. Search for a specific pattern in a file:

   ```
   grep 'pattern' file.txt
   ```

2. Case-insensitive search:

   ```
   grep -i 'pattern' file.txt
   ```

3. Search for a pattern recursively in a directory:

   ```
   grep -r 'pattern' directory/
   ```

### Advanced usage

Here are a few more advanced and powerful options that `grep` offers:

- Use regular expressions to define complex patterns.
- Search for multiple patterns simultaneously.
- Invert the search and display lines that do not match.
- Count the number of occurrences of a pattern.
- Search for patterns within specific line ranges.

For more information on advanced usage, check the `grep` man page using the command `man grep`.

## sed

`sed` (stream editor) is a powerful text manipulation tool that operates on streams of text. It allows you to perform various operations like searching, replacing, deleting, and inserting text.

### Basic usage

Here are some examples of basic `sed` commands:

1. Replace occurrences of a pattern with another string:

   ```
   sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file.txt
   ```

2. Delete lines that match a pattern:

   ```
   sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
   ```

3. Insert text before or after a pattern-matched line:

   ```
   sed '/pattern/i text' file.txt
   sed '/pattern/a text' file.txt
   ```

4. Write the changes to a new file:

   ```
   sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file.txt > newfile.txt
   ```

### Advanced usage

`sed` offers more advanced features as well, including:

- Using regular expressions to perform complex pattern matching.
- Running multiple `sed` commands sequentially.
- Applying changes within specific line ranges.
- Writing changes to multiple files simultaneously.

For more information on advanced usage, refer to the `sed` man page using the command `man sed`.

## awk

`awk` is a programming language specifically designed for text processing and data extraction. It allows you to define patterns and actions, making it a versatile tool for analyzing and manipulating structured text data.

### Basic usage

Here are some basic `awk` commands:

1. Print specific columns from a delimited file:

   ```
   awk -F ',' '{print $1, $2}' file.csv
   ```

2. Filter rows based on a specific condition:

   ```
   awk '$3 > 100 {print}' file.txt
   ```

3. Perform mathematical calculations on columns:

   ```
   awk '{total += $1} END {print total}' file.txt
   ```

### Advanced usage

`awk` provides advanced features such as:

- Defining custom delimiters for input files.
- Using regular expressions to match patterns.
- Writing complex algorithms for data manipulation.
- Defining variables and functions within an `awk` script.

For more information on how to utilize `awk` effectively, consult the `awk` man page by running the command `man awk`.

These text processing tools—`grep`, `sed`, and `awk`—serve as powerful utilities for manipulating and analyzing text data efficiently. By mastering their capabilities, you can significantly enhance your command line productivity and gain better control over textual information.
