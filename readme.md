# GPT-Wiki-Creator

## Project Goals

Hey there! Welcome to `gpt-wiki-creator`. Ever wanted to learn something new but didn't know where to start? This project is all about automating that process for you! We use GPT-4 to generate super-cool, reliable, and well-structured articles or summaries on just about any topic. But wait, there's more! We can also send these notes straight to your Notion app. So you get to focus more on learning and less on the boring stuff.

- **Skills Showcased:**
  - Working with APIs (like GPT-4 and Notion)
  - Language Model Manipulation (LLM)
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Utilization of "chain of thought" prompting techniques
