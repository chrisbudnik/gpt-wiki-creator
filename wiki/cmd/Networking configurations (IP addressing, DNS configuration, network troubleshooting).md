# Networking Configurations

In this article, we will explore various networking configurations in the command line interface for Mac. We will cover important topics such as IP addressing, DNS configuration, and network troubleshooting. 

## IP Addressing

An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a computer network. It enables devices to communicate with each other over the network. 

### Finding your IP Address

To find your IP address in the command line interface, you can use the `ifconfig` command. Open the Terminal and type the following command to retrieve your IP address:

```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{ print $2}'
```

This command filters the output of `ifconfig` to only display the lines containing "inet" (IPv4 addresses) and excludes the loopback address (127.0.0.1).

## DNS Configuration

DNS (Domain Name System) resolution is the process of converting domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses. Let's explore various commands to manage DNS configurations.

### Checking DNS Servers

To check the DNS servers currently configured on your system, use the `scutil` command:

```bash
scutil --dns | grep "nameserver"
```

This command will display a list of DNS servers used by your system for DNS resolution.

### Changing DNS Server

To change the DNS server being used, you can modify the Network Interface settings or use the `networksetup` command in the following way:

```bash
networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

This command updates the DNS servers for the Wi-Fi interface to Google's public DNS servers. Replace `Wi-Fi` with the appropriate network interface on your system.

## Network Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting network issues is an essential skill for system administrators. Let's explore a few tools and techniques to diagnose and resolve network problems.

### Ping

The `ping` command is used to test connectivity between two hosts. It sends an ICMP echo request to the target and waits for a response. To use `ping`, open the Terminal and type the following command:

```bash
ping google.com
```

This command sends ICMP echo requests to google.com and displays the round-trip time along with packet loss information.

### Traceroute

The `traceroute` command allows you to trace the route taken by IP packets from your computer to a target host. It shows each intermediate hop along with its round-trip time. To trace the route to a host, use the following command:

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

This command displays the IP addresses of the routers and the round-trip time for each hop.

## Conclusion
